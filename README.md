# 4.2PenTest_Final.sh

## Introduction

`4.2PenTest_Final.sh` is an advanced network penetration testing tool designed to automate the process of scanning networks, identifying vulnerabilities, and checking for weak credentials. This script utilizes `nmap` and `searchsploit` for comprehensive vulnerability assessment and `hydra` for password testing.

## Features

- **Network Scanning:** Supports both Basic and Full scans using `nmap`.
- **Vulnerability Mapping:** Identifies vulnerabilities using `nmap` scripts and `searchsploit`.
- **Weak Password Checking:** Utilizes `hydra` to test common passwords across various services.
- **Detailed Logging:** Logs results for easy analysis and reporting.
- **Automated Reporting:** Results are auto-zipped and include detailed summaries.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed:
- `nmap`
- `hydra`
- `searchsploit`
- `zip`

## Usage

This script requires root privileges to execute some commands. It is recommended to run it as `sudo` for full functionality.

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Panhavisal/PenTest-Project.git
   cd yourrepository
   ```

2. **Make the Script Executable:**

   ```bash
   chmod +x 4.2PenTest_Final.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**

   ```bash
   sudo ./4.2PenTest_Final.sh
   ```

4. **Follow the Prompts:**
   - Enter the network range or IP (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24` or `192.168.1.1`).
   - Choose the scan type: `Basic` or `Full`.
   - Select if you want to use a custom password list.
   - The script will then perform scans and display results.

## Output

- The results are stored in the specified output directory, which includes:
  - **Scan Files:** Results of the scans (`.txt` files) for each IP.
  - **Searchsploit Files:** Detailed vulnerability reports.
  - **Weak Password Files:** Reports of weak passwords found.
  - **Summary:** A comprehensive summary of the scan results.
  - **Results.zip:** Compressed archive of all results for easy sharing and archiving.

### Example Output

- `results.zip` - Archive containing all results.
- `summary.txt` - Summary of the network scan.
- `192.168.240.134_Full_scan.txt` - Full scan results for a specific IP.
- `192.168.240.134_searchsploit.txt` - Vulnerability analysis report.
- `weak_passwords_192.168.240.134.txt` - Weak password findings for a specific IP.

## Important Notes

- **Running as Root:** The script requires root privileges for certain network operations. Always run it using `sudo` to ensure full functionality.
- **Legal Disclaimer:** Ensure you have permission to scan and test the networks. Unauthorized testing is illegal and unethical.
